# Immersive Route Preview Feature

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive immersive route preview feature that provides a Street View-like simulation with custom map styling, real-time safety overlays, and an auto-panning camera experience.

## New Features Added

### 1. ImmersiveRoutePreview Component (`src/components/ImmersiveRoutePreview.js`)

A full-screen modal component that provides:

- **Street View Simulation**: High-pitched camera angles (60°) with street-level zoom for immersive viewing
- **Auto-Panning Camera**: Automatically moves through route checkpoints every 3 seconds
- **Route Walkthrough with Checkpoints**: Divides route into 8 key checkpoints with progress tracking
- **Custom Map Styling**: Immersive map theme with enhanced road visibility and building details
- **Real-time Safety Overlays**: Color-coded safety indicators along the route
- **Interactive Controls**: Play/pause, manual checkpoint navigation, and street view toggle

### 2. Enhanced GoogleMapsService

Added new method `getImmersiveMapStyle()` that provides:

- Custom map styling for better route visibility
- Enhanced road geometry and building details
- Optimized colors for immersive viewing experience

### 3. Updated Theme Constants

Added `large` shadow style for better component elevation in the immersive modal.

## Key Features

### Immersive Simulation

- **Auto-panning Camera**: Smoothly moves between checkpoints with calculated bearing angles
- **Street View Mode**: Toggle between overview and street-level perspectives
- **3D Camera Angles**: Uses pitch and heading for realistic navigation simulation

### Safety Integration

- **Real-time Safety Overlays**: Displays color-coded safety zones along the route
- **Safe Spot Markers**: Shows nearby police stations, hospitals, and pharmacies
- **Safety-focused Design**: Visual indicators to help users make informed decisions

### Interactive Controls

- **Progress Bar**: Shows real-time progress through the route
- **Manual Navigation**: Previous/next checkpoint controls
- **Auto-play Toggle**: Start/stop automatic progression
- **Street View Toggle**: Switch between map and street-level views

### User Experience

- **Full-screen Modal**: Immersive viewing experience
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe down to close
- **Smooth Animations**: 2-second camera transitions between checkpoints
- **Contextual Instructions**: Dynamic instructions based on current checkpoint

## How to Test

1. **Start the App**: The Expo development server should be running
2. **Enter a Destination**: Search for a nearby location in the search bar
3. **Select a Route**: Choose from the available route options
4. **Preview Route**: Tap the "Preview Route" button (eye icon)
5. **Experience the Simulation**:
   - Watch the auto-panning camera move through checkpoints
   - Use play/pause controls to control progression
   - Toggle street view mode for closer inspection
   - Navigate manually using previous/next buttons
   - Swipe down or tap X to close

## Technical Implementation

### Camera Controls

```javascript
mapRef.current.animateCamera(
  {
    center: { latitude: checkpoint.latitude, longitude: checkpoint.longitude },
    pitch: streetViewMode ? 60 : 30, // Street view-like angle
    heading: calculatedBearing,
    altitude: streetViewMode ? 200 : 500,
    zoom: streetViewMode ? 18 : 16,
  },
  { duration: 2000 }
);
```

### Safety Overlays

- Generates safety overlays at regular intervals along the route
- Uses randomized safety levels for demonstration (can be integrated with real safety data)
- Color-coded indicators (green for safe, amber for caution)

### Checkpoint Generation

- Automatically divides route into 8 strategic checkpoints
- Calculates progress percentage for each checkpoint
- Generates contextual instructions based on route progress

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Street View Integration**: Connect with Google Street View API for actual street imagery
2. **Voice Navigation**: Add turn-by-turn voice instructions during preview
3. **360° View**: Implement panoramic street view capabilities
4. **Real Safety Data**: Integrate with actual crime and safety databases
5. **Social Features**: Allow users to share route previews
6. **Offline Mode**: Cache route previews for offline viewing

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ImmersiveRoutePreview.js` - New immersive preview component
2. `src/services/GoogleMapsService.js` - Added immersive map styling
3. `src/constants/theme.js` - Added large shadow style
4. `src/screens/HomeScreen.js` - Integrated immersive preview functionality

The feature is now ready for testing and provides a comprehensive immersive route preview experience that simulates Street View navigation with enhanced safety features.
